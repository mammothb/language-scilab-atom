# Scilab language support in Atom

Adds syntax highlighting and snippets to Scilab files in Atom.

[Converted](http://atom.io/docs/latest/converting-a-text-mate-bundle)
from the [Scilab TextMate bundle](https://github.com/textmate/scilab.tmbundle).

This package originally belongs to akfoss, who has deleted his/her github
account, I have modified this package to fix the comment issue.
